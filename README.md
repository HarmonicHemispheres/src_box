Welcome to `SRC_BOX`, my personal blog and experimental idea workbench. The idea behind this blog 
really lies in a concept of using `Github` as a blogging platform for (but not limited to) technical topics.
Since most technology, science and philosophy blogs online tend to share resources such as code, project examples, and other material, I thought it would be interesting to see if a collaboration between `Github` and
a science journalism format could provide an interesting and useful way to blog.

Topics you can expect to find here will relate primarily to technology and programming, however also expect to 
see art, graphic design, 3d modeling, music production, philosophy and other topics as well.

`SRC_BOX` uses `git` and `Github` to capitalize on two valuable aspects: __Continuous Content__ and __Repeatable Behavior__ intended to be a living blog using a science journal format. Each year a new `Volume` will be started and throughout the year `Issues` will be added to the volume's directory. In addition each issue will correspond with a issue on the github issue board to allow for comments, suggestions, example discussion, ect.

For more details on what I'm calling, _Git Based Blogging_ see the first issue, [Github for Blogging](vol-1/issue-1/post.md).
