There is a general trend in software to hide details through abstraction. The "magic sauce" that makes a product great and makes life easier for its users. Today i want to discuss why i believe abstraction in many modern software products hurts its users in the long run than helps them.

## The Promise
At the start users feel overwhelmed by details and turn to abstraction products to "remove the hassle" and "take care of it" for them. This is when they turn to the Magical Potions of Software Services. They find great splashy websites, fancy UI's and a list of features that sound like a perfect concoction to ail their pain. What they do not expect is what happens once the potion wheres off.

## The Curse Realized
After a longer period of use, users start wanting to do more. They feel comfortable with the shallow water and want to finally go out to bigger surfs, only to find they had been training in a swimming pool the whole time.

## The Exodus
It comes to a point where leaving the abstract tools is the road to freedom.
